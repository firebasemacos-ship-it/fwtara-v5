// This is a dummy call just to separate the replace and the append.
// I will actually append the function using replace_file_content (appending to end of file isn't supported directly, so I'll replace the last line or use a known anchor).
// Accessing file end is hard without reading it all.
// I'll try to insert it before the last brace or just use replace_file_content on a known function.
